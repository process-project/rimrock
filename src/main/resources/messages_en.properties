rimrock.description = Rimrock application simplify the way how you can interact with the remote servers. It allows to execute application in batch mode or start interactive application, where application output can be fetched online and new input can be send using simple REST interface. What is more by using dedicated REST interface you will be able to start new job on the infrastructure. You don't need to care about the way how to create correct job description using JDI (Job description language) - just pass the command you want to execute and we will do the rest.

team.dh.bio = I am a graduate of Computer Science major at the University of Science and Technology in Krakow. At Cyfronet, I participate in various national and European research initiatives focusing on the usability of large computation and storage infrastructures. My area of interest includes web development, dynamic languages and remote desktop utilisation.
team.mk.bio = I graduated from the University of Science and Technology in Krak\u00f3w, Poland, where I received my M.Sc. in Computer Science. In the 2005 I joined Technologies Group in Research and development department in ComArch (2005-2010) where I was responsible for designing and developing solutions for telecommunication management and meta-modeling. In 2006 I have joined DICE team where I have been involved in the EU-funded projects. My current work addresses areas such as distributed resource discovery, distributed cloud based application design and implementation.
team.mp.bio = M.Sc. in Applied Computer Science from University of Science and Technology.
